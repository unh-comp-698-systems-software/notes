## Agenda

* Monitoring your application
* Final Project Discussion

## Monitoring

Another key piece to our architecture is monitoring.  It is always
better if you can tell when something is wrong before your
clients or customers do.  Here we'll be using Prometheus
to monitor our Python flask server.  We'll monitor some system
level metrics such as CPU and Memory utilization along
with some application level metrics such as number of 
page loads and page load time.

### How Prometheus Monitors

Prometheus (https://prometheus.io/) works on poll-based model where metrics
are tracked with Counters, Gauges, Histograms, 
and Summaries.

Counters

> A counter is a cumulative metric that represents a single numerical value that only ever goes up. A counter is typically used to count requests served, tasks completed, errors occurred, etc. Counters should not be used to expose current counts of items whose number can also go down, e.g. the number of currently running goroutines. Use gauges for this use case.

Gauges

> A gauge is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.  Gauges are typically used for measured values like temperatures or current memory usage, but also "counts" that can go up and down, like the number of running goroutines.

Histogram

> A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum of all observed values.

Summary

> Similar to a histogram, a summary samples observations (usually things like request durations and response sizes). While it also provides a total count of observations and a sum of all observed values, it calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window.

A Prometheus client/server set can be paired with a grafana front end
to 


Metrics are created through a combination of labels and tags such
as this request counter.

```
app:request_count{endpoint="/metrics",http_status="200",method="GET"}
```

Here we are counting items called app:requests and the counts will
get broken out into subgroups based on the labels provided.  The 
labels provide the flexibility to measure the same dimension
across multiple usages and lump them together.

### Modify your unh698.py and redeploy with ansible

The `prometheus_client` library needs to be added to your image
via the Dockerfile.  Either through a separate pip install
or if you used a requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install prometheus_client
```

add the following code to you unh698.py file.  The import 
should be added at the top of the file with the rest of
the imports.  The `setup_metrics` call should be inserted
after the `app = Flask(__name__)` line.

```python
from prometheus_metrics import setup_metrics
setup_metrics(app)
```

Create a new prometheus_metrics.py file in the same
directory as the unh698.py file.  The following
contents:

```python
import time
from flask import request
from flask import Response
from prometheus_client import Summary, Counter, Histogram
from prometheus_client.exposition import generate_latest
from prometheus_client.core import  CollectorRegistry
from prometheus_client.multiprocess import MultiProcessCollector

_INF = float("inf")
# Create a metric to track time spent and requests made.
REQUEST_TIME = Histogram(
    'app:request_processing_seconds', 
    'Time spent processing request',
    ['method', 'endpoint'],
    buckets=tuple([0.0001, 0.001, .01, .1, 1, _INF])
)
REQUEST_COUNTER = Counter(
    'app:request_count', 
    'Total count of requests', 
    ['method', 'endpoint', 'http_status']
)


def setup_metrics(app):
    @app.before_request
    def before_request():
        request.start_time = time.time()

    @app.after_request
    def increment_request_count(response):
        request_latency = time.time() - request.start_time
        REQUEST_TIME.labels(request.method, request.path
            ).observe(request_latency)

        REQUEST_COUNTER.labels(request.method, request.path,
                response.status_code).inc()
        return response

    @app.route('/metrics')
    def metrics():
        return Response(generate_latest(), mimetype="text/plain")
```

## Final Project

The final project for this class will be due at the end of the 
semester.  The task is to reproduce what we've done with a
website of your own.  This will focus on two aspects. 1) how well you can replicate the infrastructure we've 
worked on in class and through 2) how well you can
explain the whats, whys, and hows of your setup. This
means documentation will be key.  The target audience of
your documentation should be students starting this
course next semester.
